RESULTING API:

POSTerminalAPI.setPricing (Character productCode, int productQuantity, float productPackPrice)
POSTerminalAPI.scan (String order)
POSTerminalAPI.calculateTotal()

POSTerminalAPI.isReadyForGetTotal ()
POSTerminalAPI.getLastErrors ()

__ RUN:
1. Main test, implementing the requirements for the task:
POSTerminalAPITest

2. Other tests:
ProductTest
POSTerminalTest

__ Assumptions:
1. The process of using an artifact (implements this API) :
- input prices for necessary products (any times - setPricing),
- input calculating orders (any times - scan),
- while (isReadyForGetTotal==false) {
      - getting last errors list (one time - getLastErrors)
      - fixing errors (registering products or adding 1-pack-prices - any times - setPricing)
}
- get order total (one time - calculateTotal).
After last operation all orders will be lost.

2. Product code (key field) - one character (char).

__ The requirement to use the artifact (with this API) (as is in the requirements):
1. We have to input 1-item-pack price, for example :
setPricing ('A', 1, 10f)

__ Perspectives:
1. For a minimal application in reality - need to change the product code to String (and do some changes in the code, yes).
